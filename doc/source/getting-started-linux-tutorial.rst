Linux Tutorial
==============

This guide will give you a brief overview of how volatility3 works as well as a demonstration of several of the plugins available in the suite.

Acquiring memory
----------------

Volatility3 does not provide the ability to acquire memory.  Below are some examples of tools that can be used to acquire memory, but more are available:

* `AVML - Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux <https://github.com/microsoft/avml>`_
* `LiME - Linux Memory Extract <https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME>`_

Be aware that LiME raw format is not supported by volatility3, the padded or lime option should be used instead. `This issue contains further information <https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME/issues/111>`_.

Procedure to create symbol tables for linux
--------------------------------------------

To create a symbol table please refer to :ref:`symbol-tables:Mac or Linux symbol tables`.

.. tip:: It may be possible to locate pre-made ISF files from the `Linux ISF Server <https://isf-server.techanarchy.net/>`_ ,
    which is built and maintained by `kevthehermit <https://twitter.com/kevthehermit>`_.
    After creating the file or downloading it from the ISF server, place the file under the directory ``volatility3/symbols/linux``.
    If necessary create a linux directory under the symbols directory (this will become unnecessary in future versions).


Listing plugins
---------------

The following is a sample of the linux plugins available for volatility3, it is not complete and more more plugins may
be added.  For a complete reference, please see the volatility 3 :doc:`list of plugins <volatility3.plugins>`.
For plugin requests, please create an issue with a description of the requested plugin.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python3 vol.py --help | grep -i linux. | head -n 5
        banners.Banners     Attempts to identify potential linux banners in an
        linux.bash.Bash     Recovers bash command history from memory.
        linux.check_afinfo.Check_afinfo
        linux.check_creds.Check_creds
        linux.check_idt.Check_idt

.. note:: Here the the command is piped to grep and head in-order to provide the start of the list of linux plugins.


Using plugins
-------------

The following is the syntax to run the volatility CLI.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python3 vol.py -f <path to memory image> <plugin_name> <plugin_option>


Example
-------

banners
~~~~~~~

In this example we will be using a memory dump from the Insomni'hack teaser 2020 CTF Challenge called Getdents.  We will limit the discussion to memory forensics with volatility 3 and not extend it to other parts of the challenge.
Thanks go to `stuxnet <https://github.com/stuxnet999/>`_ for providing this memory dump and `writeup <https://stuxnet999.github.io/insomnihack/2020/09/17/Insomihack-getdents.html>`_.


.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python3 vol.py -f memory.vmem banners

The above command helps us to find the memory dump's kernel version and the distribution version. Now using the above banner we can search for the needed ISF file from the ISF server.
If ISF file cannot be found then, follow the instructions on :ref:`getting-started-linux-tutorial:Procedure to create symbol tables for linux`. After that, place the ISF file under the ``volatility3/symbols/linux`` directory.

.. tip:: Use the banner text which is most repeated to search from ISF Server.

Now to find the commands that were run in the bash shell by using ``linux.bash``.

PIDs, TIDs, and TGID
--------------------
Typically processes are a collection of threads that are working together for a single program to run. On Windows `notepad.exe` would be a process that might contain multiple threads, in task manager you would only see the single process. In Linux you will also see processes split into multiple threads working together, however Linux uses a single `task` structure to represent processes and the threads that make them up.

This can cause confusion as a `task_struct` includes a `pid` field which you may resonaibly assume is "the pid". The issue is that what "the pid" is in linux depends on the context. Within the kernel "the pid" is exactly that `pid`` field, however from the users view "the pid" almost always actually means `tgid`. This can be seen in the `sys_getpid` function from the Linux kernel:

.. code-block:: sys_getpid
    /**
    * sys_getpid - return the thread group id of the current process
    *
    * Note, despite the name, this returns the tgid not the pid.  The tgid and
    * the pid are identical unless CLONE_THREAD was specified on clone() in
    * which case the tgid is the same in all threads of the same group.
    *
    * This is SMP safe as current->tgid does not change.
    */

This is why many volatility3 plugins use the `tgid` member for "pid" and the `pid` member for "tid". The `tgid` member more accuratly represents the process id (pid) you would see in a `ps` output while the `pid` member is more like a thread id (tid).
